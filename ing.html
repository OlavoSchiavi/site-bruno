                        <p class="sc3tx1">Absence of combustion chamber:</p>
                        <p class="sc3tx1">Unlike traditional liquid propellant rockets, which have a combustion chamber where the fuel and oxidizer are mixed and burned to generate thrust, cold gas rockets do not have such a chamber. Instead, they use compressed gas to push the liquid propellant straight out of the tanks and expel it through an exhaust nozzle.</p>

                        <p class="sc3tx1">In cold gas rockets, the liquid propellant and compressed gas are stored in separate tanks. The liquid propellant is kept at cryogenically low temperatures to increase its density and allow for greater storage capacity. Compressed gas is used to pressurize the propellant and push it out of the tanks during burning.</p>

                        <p class="sc3tx1">Since there is no combustion chamber, cold gas rockets have a simpler design compared to other types of rockets. This means they don't have to deal with the high pressure and extreme temperatures generated in the combustion chamber. This results in lighter and less complex structures.</p>

                    <p class="sc3tx1">Security:</p>
                    <p class="sc3tx1">Cold gas rockets are considered safer compared to traditional liquid propellant rockets as they do not involve burning fuel and oxidizer in a combustion chamber. This reduces the risk of catastrophic explosions. However, there are still risks associated with the handling and storage of cryogenic propellants and compressed gases.</p>

                    <p class="sc3tx1">Performance limitations:</p>
                    <p class="sc3tx1">Cold gas rockets have some limitations over traditional liquid propellant rockets. They generally offer lower specific efficiency (ratio between generated thrust and propellant consumption) due to simplified design. Furthermore, the lack of a combustion chamber precludes the possibility of fine-tuning the thrust during flight.</p>

            <p class="sc6tx1">For a rocket to launch, it needs to overcome the force of gravity acting on it. To do this, it produces an upward force (thrust) that "fights" against the force that is pulling it down (gravity).<br>To produce the thrust force, rocket engines produce combustion gases, usually using hydrogen liquid as fuel and liquid oxygen as oxidant, these gases are expelled by the rocket's nozzles, pushing against the upper wall of the nozzles. The relationship between the forces can be summarized by Newton's third law, in which every action causes a reaction of equal force and opposite direction, the gases are expelled with such force that it overcomes the weight of the rocket, propelling it upwards. . We can use the following equation to demonstrate:</p>
